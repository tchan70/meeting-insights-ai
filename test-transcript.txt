Hey team, thanks for joining. I wanted to kick off this project
planning session for Q1.
Sarah, you mentioned last week you'd have the API design doc
ready - do you have an update on that?
Sarah: Yes, I finished it yesterday. The main decision we need to
make is whether to use REST or GraphQL. I'm leaning toward REST
for simplicity, but I want to hear thoughts.
Mike: I agree with REST. We can always add GraphQL later if we
need it. When can you start implementation?
Sarah: I can start next Monday. I'll need about 2 weeks for the
initial version.
Great, let's move forward with REST. Mike, can you handle the
frontend integration once Sarah's API is ready?
Mike: Yep, I'll block out the last week of January for that.
Perfect. One more thing - we need to nail down our database
choice. Are we going with Postgres or MongoDB?
Sarah: I vote Postgres. We'll need transactions and relational
data.
Mike: Agreed on Postgres.
Alright, Postgres it is. Sarah, can you set up the initial schema
by end of week?
Sarah: Will do.
Awesome. Let's reconvene next Wednesday to check progress. Thanks
everyone!
